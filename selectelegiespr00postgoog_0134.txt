We have seen from an exampla¹ that Propoitius
often adopts a very strange arrangement oi
words, aud mora instances ol such hyper-
bata or transpositione may be gothered from Hertzberg.
Iwill add some dislocations of words which arc ap
pareutly duo to the influence of metro, the next subject
that we shall treat of. They consist chiefly in post-
poning particles to a lator place than their proper one
in the sentence; sometimes however‚as in 1. 2. 30 omnia
quaeque (for omniaque quae) Venus quaeque Minerua
probat, they maha tham occupy an earlier one. Though
they occur in pentameters, we do not find the special
variety which is such a favoun'ta of Tibullus and to a
less extent of ovid, viz. a quadrisyllable in the last
half followed by a que3 e. g. Tib. 11. 5. 72 multus utin

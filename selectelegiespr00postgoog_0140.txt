But neither is this persectly satisfactory. Mr
Fennell has suggested to me that soene
classes of words may have been avoided {mg α’ ‘l‘
by Propertius. And this I think will
lead us to the true solution, '

First we expect that words which were avoided
in the disyllabis endings would be avoided
iu the trisyllabic. This will exclude pro sslfflllffihr
occano, oonjccnctc'ona and most moade. And ffl'd'm’
ws shall expect to find few orljectivca
Verbo are avoided sor another reason. Containing, as
they generally do, the pith of the sentence, they
receive a double emphasis at the end of tha line ;
und so call attention to the lact that the ending is
trisyllabio and unusual. Besides this, as they very
frequently end with an explosivs consonant, eg.
sedeat (Tibullus), they would in that position, so to
speak, pull a Roman up much in the same way as
a final p or b does an Englishman¹. Nouae then are
leit. Now (i) in these(as also in adjectivae and adverbs)
the socalled ‘liquid' suffixos are exceedingly com·

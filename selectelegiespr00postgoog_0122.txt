. It sometimes gives a special force to the expression
which ie easy to feel, but difficult to render ,· ,

v. 8. 53, 54 pocula mi digitos inter occidere mmm
remissos palluerantque ipso labra soluta

mero ‘fell’...‘were overspreed with pallor,' ib. 82 re-
spondi ego ‘legibus utar! riserat, of a sudden laugh.
So in v. 9. 27, 28 deuia puniceae uelabant limina uittae,
putris odorato luxerat igne oasa I believe the tense
tttlltlt? tltltlltlllttl‘lt rplafigippia
nificarnttlratP1·0peltius carries this fondness sor elie

plnperfect still further. We find doubleloacled plu·

perfecta, so tospeak. Not to speak of the

instanoes above where oltra and aule occur sssssslffiffl

with that tense, we have 111. 21 (18). 3

fueras mentita (for aas), 111. 24 (20). 21 suerat deuota,
1. 16. l quaesitorum magnis olim patefacta triumphis
[So in the fut. ιν. t) (10). 29 suerit exacta, and perf.
subj.1v. 23. ll.]

This is the place to spcak of the Part participle,
which the perf. and pluperf. share in eom·
» mon. That participle marks an action as
past, but not necessarily as past aa regards the main
verb. Ita use may only indicate that it was past
when the account was written. Thus it may repre·
sent (a) a dependent sentence with main verb in o.
pasl tense (pert, imperf„ pluperi.) defined os postte
the main verb, a perfect participle3 (l) an action abac
lutely past, but rtet defined aa to the main verb, an
corta participle 3 (c) an action absolutely past, but
ol the same time aa the main verb. For example iu
Livy 2. 36. l sub furca coecum egerat without the
context might be taken either (a) ‘he drove him efter
he lad beaten him’ perf, or (b) ‘he drove and beat him’
tt· thilallrlll lt <thath liliallll
a use of it which does not differ at all from a pre·

Post participle.

INTRODUOTION. xxxvii

tho first flood of passion must inevitably sweep away.
It was Oynthia’s form that opened the flood-gates ; and
the sudden irresistible deluge carried all before it,
maxims of prudence, conventional restraints end the
wealr rebellion of the will The havoc which this at
tachmcnt undoubtedly produced was certainly not
repaired by his life at Rome. A life which consisted
to a very large extent of convivial pleasure and social
distractione and which was not steadied either by fixed
ahns or regular employment, still further weshened
and disintegrated his character. The very cassand
completeness of Cynthia’s victory was a presago that
it could not lest. A heart so light and impression-
able invited conquest of itself. We should rather
wonder that, withso much in himself to boget fickle-
ness and so much in Cynthia to justify it, the passion
lasted so long, than. that his professione of fides¹
were not always exaetly interpreted, and tha-t his
admirationes Cynthia ‹lissolvcd into a universal ten-
derness¹. A strict morelist must condemn Propertins’
attachment, and his unfaithfulness to it is still less to
be excused. But when we have allowed for the influ-
ence of his age, from whose grosscr taints he was
entirely free, the temptatione aad provocatione of his
position and the effecte of his natural infirmity, the
remainrler is too poor for our censure ς it rather merits
our eompassron.

Such then in broad outline was the character of

the principal elegiae poet of Rome: weak but emiable,
witha capacity for tenderness and a gentleness and
placability of temper as its chief merite and irresolu-
tion and inconstancy as its most glaring faults. A
commonplace character certainly ; and one which we
are startled to discover united with a genius so strange

¹ To a fine ear, perhaps, Propertius does ‘protest too much.¹

'l'ms poem, addressed to Tullus, is a sort ol envoi to the

first bools, It contains an account, not very precise, ot the
post's birthplnce, with a parenthesis lamenting the melancholy
late ot his relation (vv. 6-8). Poets not unfrequently added
en account ol thie kind to awolnme ot their poema, just es

example.

home, thou‘ art ever esking, Tullus, in our friendslrip's name.
1r thou dost know Perusia, thy eonntry's grave-yard, the scene
of death in Italy's hard days when striis with Rome muddened
Rome‘s own sone-to me, Etruscan earth, there should be
chielest sorrow: thou hest left my kinaman's corso to lie
unburied, thou eoverest his bones with no dole ol dust-
Umbrio gave me birth where it touchee close the plains below
with its wenltlr of fertile land'

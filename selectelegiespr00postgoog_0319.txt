2³, 24. ’111616 lines seem to point to the other legend oi
the death ot Argynnus, which represented him as lost while
swimming in the Gephissus in Boeotia. Prot. Ellis thinks that
‘the original legend was connected with the Boeotian coast, that
it subsequently extended to the opposite side of the Aegean,
aud thet Propertius who, ea a leamsd man, had heard the
story connected with both looalities, indicatos in these two
lines somewhat awkwardly the connexion! He paraphrases
the four lines thus: ιΡ. was wrecked on the coast which re-
tains the name 61 1116 lost Argynnus, that youth whom Aga-
memnon vainly sought to discover, aud kept the ficet at Aulis

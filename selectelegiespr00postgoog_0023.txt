xiv ' INTRODUOPION.

Like most of the great pcets ol Italy, Propertius
came from the North. He tells us himself
that hs was an Umbrian and carefully
describes the district where he was born, the fair and
fertile valley between Perusia and the river Clitum
nus. But the exact locality hee been disputed. Messa-
nia, now Bevagna, Hispellum, now Spello, and other
towns heve claimed the poet for their own: and their
claimsthsve been supported by argument and, we
grieve to add, also by forgery. But there is no doubt
that it was Asisium or Assisi, the birth-place of the
famous St Francis, that is entitled to the honour.
His native place was on the side ol a bill not far from
Perugis, as his expressions clearly shew, si Perusina
nti patriae sunt nota sepulcra, proxima supposito
contingens Vmbria campo nse yenuit¹ and scanden-
tes si quis censet ele uallibus arces, inpenio muros

ἱ uertisset illc neeo'. Now Asisium rs situsted on the
west slope ol the Apenninus st the bead of the valley, v ’
about twelve miles from Perusia, while Hispellum rs
st their scot, and Meuania some distance iu the, plain,
both being over twenty miles from Perusia. This

· identification is completely established by the general
description which the poet gives of his natira country,

strennue

in which there rs a distinct allusion to the passage
already quoted. Vmbria te notis unique Penatibus

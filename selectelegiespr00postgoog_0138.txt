INTRODUOTIOAE cxxix

Dr Atkinson in an ingenious paper in Hermathena,
vol. 1. p. 276, has enunciated a metrical canon fer
Propertius which he calls the

Runa or rna L1ouu>

as follows :-“N ο pentameter iu Propertius ends in
a trisyllable unless the word contains a

liqow, usually in either the penult or ,mg

tho ultimate syllable.''

For example pueri, melius, manibus. Το this hc

Paley’s note, which runs “ This verse is faulty not

former pa1·t’' which he misunderstands, I think, to
mean that all are faulty which do not have “in tho
former part a corinterbalancing epithet to every noun
in the hinder‚'’ an absurd proposition as he easily
shews3 whereas what l conceive is meant is that this
is the case where the ending is trisyllabis

The argument of Dr Atkinson for the ‘rulo of the
liquid’ on the strength of which he alters

forre soria' may be summed up as follows.

He finds that in Propertius' 2010 pentameters there

are 50 trisyllabis endings, i. s. 2 ‘aon-liquid' (cubitum,
acaia), 46 ‘liquid' and 2 in -ibas (pedibus) which, for
some reason or other, he thinks should be put in a

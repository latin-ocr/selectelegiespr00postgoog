Propertius was very widely read ιιι the literary
circles oi Rome for many centuries, end0

the writings of almost cll the poeta who⁰ ”mm

' succeeded him bear traces of hrs miluence The influ-

ence which ho had on Juvenal hae been already pointed
ι out by Mr Palmer. Martial too quotes from him and
imitatos him sometimes. Statius had read him very
carelully. He often follows him very closely iu points
oi phrasoology3 eg. in rare words like eadmerus,
’ incinuere in a literal sense. His very mention ol
him ehews how well he knew him, Silv. l. 2. 253 huno

rius Flaccos and Silius Italicum all had read him.
The author oi the poem on Aetna imitatas him¹. So

lineae idyll) on a couplet of his v. 5. 61, 62. Some
ol the prore writers too seem to have studied him,

ancient writer whom we can make sure was acquaint-
ed with him was tho Greek epigmmmctist Paullus
Sdemiorius, who lived in the time of J ustinisn I. On
his imitatione of Propertius see Hertzb. p. 230. But
there is a much later writer who may have had Pro-
pertius before him, as he certainly had many other an-
cient authors, Nicetes Eugoaiaaue,aGreek romancer iu

Α Bccdrcnc’ rud Patner’r texte cerne into my hande
when the bullr oi my worlr wee done. But I herc
neverthelees been able ιο melre rome ure of them. In
preparing the Notee end Introduction 1 heve ulco
referred ιο several progmmmer and dissertatione cs
well ee pepere in the leemed journeln Amongst the
former I may mention those of Nodbc, Peerlkamp,
Ileydeurcicd, Εοοήεπιονο, *Erit-johann, *Occu Rosc-
bcry, Sandctrdm, dultin, *Iiccpt (Opueculu) dc.

In the Introduction my obligatione to tho fore-
going ere chiefly ιο Hertzberg, Vol 1., end in Oh. IV.
ιο L. Mdller. But the greater part of it ie the out
come oi independent reflection und receerch, end
where my fecto are tehen from Hertzberg my treat-
ment of them ie often quite different to hie. Ι muet
rrelr leave nguin to point out thet Ι hove often been
obliged ιο he briefer then Ι could heve wished und
that in consequence the facte that I heve edvunced
for a position cre generally intended to be exemples
ιο elucidcte it, not evidence to prove it. The rame
enforced brevIty hae often prevented me from deve-
loping c question into cll ite collaterel iseuee end
defining ite relatione ιο everything connected with it.
Το take a single example, 1 heve given e short eketch
of the grammar of Propertius without, ee alrule,
attemptiug to frume it, ae it were‚jin the grammatico]
usage of the Letin langunge ae a whole. ”

Oi Gremmers, Ι heve chiefly used Roby‚ thnor
und Dreeger. I heve referred very frequently to
nectere Gallus and Rich'e Dictionary of Antiquitier‚

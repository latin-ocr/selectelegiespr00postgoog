est medicina figurae: nudus Amor formae noa maai
η artificem. (where see note) 3 in ιιι. 3. 20 eapula
umbra mea is a reminiscence of Plautus (quoted

in‘ thenote). 11. 6. 26 et quaecumque uiri semino
limen amar is from Horace Od. l. 25. 4 amamus
ianua limen. I have pointed out the same tendency
in 1v. 24. 7(whcre see note)and1V. 7. 58¹, m h

lwith all his love of variety and inclination ιο change,
Propertius has a large number of phrases into which
his thought seems naturally ιο fall. Ol these Ι have
already given some exemplos and drawn some inser-
irances irom them (p. xl). Their number need aot sur·

tion might shew us, need we wonder that their meaning
often fluctuatss and sometimes disappears They are
the buoys in Propertius’ troubled sea of thought and
they charein its heavings. There was another cause
for these repetitions which we must not neglect.
Propertius was deeply imbued with the spirit of
>Greek literature, and he felt with a
true poet's instinct that his own lan-
guage was in itself incapable of producing the qua
lities which attracted him. Consequently he called in
the assistance of art, and, following in the steps oi his
Alexandriae masters, he has succeeded better perhaps
than any other Roman poet in giving ιο his verse
something of the harmony and symmetry ol the
Greek. I cannot- spara space to demonstrate this at
length: for one illustration will suffice and Hertzberg
(pp. lorsqq.) has given many. Itis very apparent iu

“ IN TRODUOTJON. lxxxiii

As the view which I have felt it my duty tc
teke about the respective merits cf Ovid, May ι n,

elegiae verse: he alone raises the solt end languid pentameter
to the dignity oi its heroic consort.” (This is just, forcible end
true; but we soon go beck tc the old style.) ⁴⁸ But it isin the
,weight cl single lines, and the manly savour ol occasional
expressions, thet the charm ol this writer is to be round: he

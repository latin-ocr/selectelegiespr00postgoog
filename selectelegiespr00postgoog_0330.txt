15. ‘For Phidias Jupiter arrays himself in ivory statua’
This line may he easily mistrauslated. The fundamental idea
which runs through it is that it is hard to tell whether the God
is there in person or in representation, tha ideal is so fully
realized. 'l'his is a frequent theme with ancient writers, when
speaking ol the Olympian Zeus; Livy 411115, of Aemilius
Paullus‘ visit to Olympia, Istum uelut praesentem intuens
sactus assium est, Lucian Somn. 8 Φειδίας ἐκεῖνος ἔδειξε sdr Ala.

16. 81 ἢ θεὸς ἦλθ’ ἐπὶ γῆν ἐξ ούρανοῦ, εἰκόνα δείξων, sperdia, ἢ σύ
y* ἔβης τὸν θεὸν ὀψόμενος. To pass on to the separate words:
Phidiacus is an emphatic predicate, ‘at the bidding, for the art
of Phidias’ The adj. is much more indefinite, but this is the
sense. For Propertius’ habit of throwing the stress of the
sentence 011 to a single word, see Introduction. luppltsr.
Of itself, this word might mean either (1) the real Zeus, the
originales (2) the Zeus of Phidias’s iumpifmtiou, his conception
of Zeus, or (3) his reclination of tlsat ideal, the statue itself.
(2) is certainly what is intended. Compare Cic. Orat. 2. duee
uem ille artifex, cumjaceret Iouis samiam aut llismmae, com
temptabatur aliquem e quc similitudinem duceret, sed ipsius ia
mente insidebat speeies pulchritudinis eximia quaedam
quum intuetu iu eaque de ad illim similitudimem artem et
manum dirigebat. Butt eexprcssion also carries somethin of
(1). First we have (cf. forma, se cruat) a hint of the personadity
of the God as suggestive of the perfect art oi the sculptor.
Zeus is not loth to be thus exhibited; ho is himself a
consenting party. (lompare the words in which Lacian de

phr. Phidiacus Iuppiter, which would be most naturally
applied to the statue itself, as in Mart. 7. 56. l. se ornat.
There is an idea of spontaneity about this, ‘naturally clothes
himself) It is rather a middle than a passive, as P. takes it.
On this see the Introduction. It is interesting to see how in
these uses which reappear in Romanos, as in s’icda ,muo-
sere si, the Latin is returning on its old path which pr uced the

this supposition. Indeed there is one consideration ‘
which is distinctly in favour of it. As already said,
the poet was alive in nc. 16. Now two years before

was the same as the propoeals referred to above (p. xxi).
Now we have already seen that even in rac. 27, when
Propertius was in the heyday of his youth and in the
first blush of the cynthia attachment, he would not
have resisted the imperial will; and in the poem
which refers to the enactment of that year he uses
expressions which shew that he regarded the separa·

not desuetude, that 'stilled the Umbrian Musa. But
this is fruitless speculation. Beyond the year 16 there e

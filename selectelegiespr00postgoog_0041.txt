There are however two noteworthy omissione on

which a word must be said We hear no mmm m
a thing of Tibullus, his elegiae rival ; nor ol maara. ,
Horace, his predecessor in the favourof Maecenas. And
Tibullus aud Horace are equally silent about Proper·
tius¹. The first omission, supposing it not to he acci-
dental, may be explained without having recoursc to
the κεραμεὺς κεραμεῖ hypothesis. Tibullus belonged
> to Messala’s circle, and thus the two poets might
, never bc thrown in each other’s way. I do not believe
that Propertius’ assertione ol originality are covertly
. aimed at Tibullus. The Propertian use and treatment '
ol the elcgy is sufficiently different from the Tibulliae
to warrant Propertius in claimiug originality without
interfering with ¹eristing claims. With Horace the
case is different. Propertius could hardly uerae aa
fail to meet him at Maecenas’ house aad Propertius.
elsewhere and to meet him frequently ; and it has
even been conjectured that the inquisitive fellow ol
Sat. l. 9 is no other than our author. Though chrono-
logy seems to forbid the supposition⁸, there is good
reason sor believing that the relations of Horace and
Propertius were not particularly friendly. There is a
passage in the second book of the Epistles 2. 87 sqq,
which can hardly he anything but a direct attach upon
Propertius.
Frater erat Romae consulti rhetor ut alter
alterius sermone meros audiret honores.

Gracchus ut hio illi foret, huio ut Mucius ille.
qui minus argutos uexat furor ssle poetas? 90

same society and in spite ol their mutual jealousies agreemg m

²The garrulam hed lost his mother and relations (v. 27).
Now Propertius' mother died, at the very earliest, in 28, which

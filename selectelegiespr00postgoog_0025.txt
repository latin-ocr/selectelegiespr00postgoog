Mommsen refers to this period, of s Gaius Propertius,
who, amongst other offioes, was trisemuir cephalis mul
proconsul. Iu luter times we hear of a Propertius
Celer, s senator in the reign of liberius, who was too
poor to support his renlr and received from the empe-
ror e subvention of a million sesterces¹ ; and ol Pro
pertice Blaesus (Passennus Paullus), *en equos spelcudi·
due, for whom see below.

'rhe date of Propertius? birth is uncertain. We
bave only the testimony of ovid that he
was older than himself, but not too old
to be his compacion. Again he places Propertius

p and Tibullus as the two links in the elegiae chain
between himself and Cornelius Gallus⁸. N ow Ovid was
born in nc. 43 and Gallus in 66. So that we shall
probably be near the mark in making bim from six to
eight years older than Ovid end in patting the year of
his birth asfflor tbereabouts.

His youth was crowded with miafortuues. He
lost his iether early, and, soon ester, his
large and well cultivated estate in the
general confiscation ot 42, a missortune which he
shared with virgil, Horace end many others. The
indignation aroused by the arbitrery messuros of the
triumviro caused a genersl rising in the North under
the leadership of L Antonius, brother of the Triumvir,
und the notorious Fulvia. This outbreuk, generally
called the bellum Perusinum, was erusbed by Octavian
by the capture and snck of Perusia in 41. This siege,
which seems to heve been attended by circumstances
of peculiar horror, mede a deep impression on the
poet’s susceptible imagination3 the moroso as it
proved intel to another ol his relations⁴, who hes been

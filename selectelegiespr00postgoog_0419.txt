I ΗΜ already pointed cut the true interpretation oi this
word in Prop. 1. a? in tho Journal ol Philology, rx. .64.
But as Ι see that Mr Palmer‚ in his critical edition o Pro·
penius, does not think this explanation worth even a mon·
tion, and prsiers to put in his text what Ι had hcpcd was tho
obsoleto wlffoetme' sulcore¹,l may bo excussi inserting hore
soma mors etailed observations on the word which Ihavs had
in manuscript ior some time, and which 1 trust may sot the
matter completely at rest Ι ieel that at tho present time 1
need no apology ior testing them upon an etymological treat-
ment.

Gomon, in his Ausspracho und Betonung (s pp. 149, 476),
derives fulcio from root osan, to hold or malie fast, prop. But
Ι think that I oon show that such was not the original meaning
oi the word, and, by establishing a correspondencs between its
uses and those oi sarcio, cun bring it into relation with the
words discussed by Curtius in his Greek Etymology, No. 413.
There he proves the existence of un Indo-European root annal<
or asson (the R and K often appearing as l and p) with tho
meaning of ⁴ presaic9‚¹ found in φράσσω (for opos-yo), φρόγ-νυ-
μι, Lat. scopu-ena, Lithuanian hrrctssic.

'I'he change oi scre to fulc shews regular Latin weakenings.
For α beooming u (through an intermediats o) before l, see
(lorssen 11. p. 149 seqq„ and for l replacing an earlier r, (lorssen
1. p. 221. We must now examine tho meaning. fulcire plainly
means to ‘precs‘ in Prop. 1. 8.7 tu pedibus teneris positos
fulcire pruinas tu potes imoh'toa, Cynthio, serre nioesl and

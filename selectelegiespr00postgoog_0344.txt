strange use oi the adj. in Hor. Epod. s. 88 uenena magistros
sae rufasque non 111111 consumere humanam uicem, ‘like
mere men) The precise meaning 01 niu is doubtful It hardly
=⁴the way 01 death’ as Hertzb. 11111111, but rather ‘the ways
or haunts 01 men‘ Oi. Hom„ 11. 6. rossemannum
ἀλεείνων. It is very possible that there moy be nn allusion
to the tombs that lined the great roads 110111- Roma, espe-
cially the Appium. There is a 01111011 passage in Seneca in
his satire on claudius (Apooolynt. 1. 2), whioh reiers to 1
tradition 01 the apotheosis 01 the two first emperors whioh hes
been nowhere else preserved. ‘Ask him who suw Drusilla
going to heaven. He will tell you thet he ssw Claudius wend-
ing on his wey “with unaven steps ” (non passibus aegris).
Will he, nill he¹ he must see 111 that is done in heaven.
Appiae niae curator est gua scir et diuam Augustam et
Tiberium Gaesarem ud dees isse? cessit 111 estre The
Romans did not mehe the same 111101 distinction as the Greeks
did between heaven, the ebode 01 the Gods, eud Elysium,
the paradise 01 the under-world. Their heroes and their
poete might 1111111 10 heaven itseli. So Ennius says 1111011

unirentur 11111 (in the lost line she is thinking 01 Elysium).
Hertzberg hus 1 ourious ideo that Propertius is alluding toa
bech way to 11111111 iram Elysium, whioh he finds in 1111 Διός

Tun subiect oi this poem 11 the loss 01 some writing teblets

1111 they were 1011011 their return with the answer. The poem
11 filled with lamentatione 101 their loss, oonjeotures about the
message whioh they oontained, end nn oties 01 1 reward 101·
their recovery. Thero is no olue to the date.

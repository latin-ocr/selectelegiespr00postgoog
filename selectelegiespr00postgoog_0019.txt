x PREFAOE.

suggestive rather than exhaustivo, butI trust that
they will supply all the information required for
understanding a very difficult author. With that end
in view, Ι have given arguments sor most of tho
poems, aud a complete translation of the first hnlf ;

’ iu performing which most delicate tnsk, Ι have nimed

at preserviug, as far ns Ι could, the full sense and
general style of the' original. Ι arn afraid that my
readers will find a certain want of uniformity in tho
notes due to the suot that Ι have had to work at them
intermittently and at long intervals. But I trust
that it will not he serious enough to cause an)r
pmotioal inconvenienoe.

Through pressure of space I have often passed over
explanations whiohI believe to be wrong bnt which
would heve been notieed in a larger commentary.
I mention this expressly, as it might otherwise be
thought that I was ignorant or negligent of the work
, of my predecessore. Ihave however generally re·
oorded the opinion of the only English editor oi
Propertius, Prof. Il. A. Paley (abbreviated P.), where
it differs from my own.

Besides Mr Paley’s edition, I have consulted the
following, of whioh the ones marked with a star ara
those that I have found the most usesul.

*Soaliqem Passernt (chiefly in Vulpi’a edition),
* Volpi, Brouklruyr, *Burrenum *Lachmann (chiefly
the first edition), Paldamm, Barth, Koinoel, *Becker
(selectione), *Herlzberg Catulli, Ἰασὼ, Keil end
L. Metller.

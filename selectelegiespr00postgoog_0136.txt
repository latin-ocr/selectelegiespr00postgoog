fresh adhesions. It becomes more and more binding
and less tolerant of exceptions: till at last it arrogates
an exclusive authority, and poses over the rival forms,
not merely as a vietor, but a vietor on its merits But
it does not follow that the regularity thus attoined is
to be set above all the stages that have preceded its
attainment It is one thing to own no lau, another
to be tied to its letter. There is a happy medium
which is not so difficult to attain as to preserve We

Propertius' general superiority in vigour and
variety to Tibullus appears also in their veisifieation
For that of Tibullus is hardly ever impressive and apt
sometimes to become monotonous. Both in hexame-

than Tibullus, and, we need not add, than Ovid.

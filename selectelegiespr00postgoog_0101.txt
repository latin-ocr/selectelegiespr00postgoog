Kuttner is right in taking acerque eti for ubinam.
So'we may add 111. 10 (9).10 qnam prior and 111. 20
(17). 25 prius...qoam ante where observo thedonbling,
'l'here are also some archaistio constructione which
will be ¹found in their-place.

The number of proper names in Propertius is very
large, and they have been gethered from
all quarters. They had a strange at-
tractiveness lor him as they have had for many other
poets, amongst whom we at once think ol Milton and
Scott He does not however use them with the same
fine effect as these writers
Α Two things are noteworthy about their use; (1) the
way in which he accumulates them to-
, gether, and (2) his habit of putting proper
names side by side in a sort of imaginary antithesis,
especially in the pentameter. Both are ‚⁴ ,
illustrated by 11. 1. 59 sqq.,1v. 13 (14). 13 mmm·

of this principle makes our way clearer in several

aillond as he is of proper names, he does not treat
them very ceremoniously. At the bid·
ding of metro he cuts them down with-
outmercy. This is especially the case with adjec-
tives Hence we have sectilia ratis, Pompeio manu,

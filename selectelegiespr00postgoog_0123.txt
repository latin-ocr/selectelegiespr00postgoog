sent participle (a) does not require illustration. (1)
in a given passage is often hard to distinguish from
(a) on the one hand or (c) or (d) on the other. Still,
I think, it is clear in 11. 9. '8 illum expectando sacta
'renransit anus ‘she remained faithful and became
old,'1v. 5 (6) 3 num me laetitia tumefactum fallisl
v. 11. 13 cantatae leges imponere lunae 3 and so where
no past has preceded, 1. 1. 19 deductae fallacia lunae
and note, lv. ll (12). 3 spoliati gloria Parthi and
others quoted by Hertzb. p. 121¹. (c) and (cl) have
become so mixed in usage (which was to be expected,
as the part. in both cases is in thereme relation to the

The past part has a present sense, ie. it is used ol
the same time as the principal verb, iu lv. 18 (19). 26
pendet Cretaea tracta puella rate, ιν. 13 (14). 6 aerei
clauis adunca trochi, v. 7. 92 nos uehimur: sactum
nauta recenset onus, and still stranger id 59 ecce
coronato pars altera aecta phaselo [lor uehitur (crecta
cet), unless, as is more probable‚ it is anacoluthic
like the pres. part; see below], 1v. l. 12 et mecum

passage of past participles into adjectivae rs now more
intelligible, p. civ.¹

There are some very odd uses of the iaJ, partly
Graecisms, (i) afterwards or verbal phrases3

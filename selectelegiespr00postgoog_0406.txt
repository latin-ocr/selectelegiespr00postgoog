APPENDIX A. , 249

Thai the tert ci Propertius ss preserved ιο us in these uss.
is ier from perfect, every scholar will cono‘ede. It is none the
less clear, however, that in msny qucrters there is a disposition
to mehe it cut ιο be more corrupt then it is, end ιο sppiy
eitemtioninplaceot interpretation. Iwill enumerate some of
the chief sources oi its mistekes. '

(i) Glericcl errore. These sre chiefly due ιο confusions oi

the cursivo chsreoter, and shew thot the lost archetype was
written in cursive, eg. stemus iorflemus, 11. 1. 2.

But some οι the corruptions go bech to on earlier stege, ond
shew unciel corruptione, eg. 111. 5 coors ior cocc1s; v. 11. 30
inre ior ηοω rv. 18 (17). 38 rvwonr for resurr.

(fi) Tiami’ffiiiim ot these I hare spoken, Introduction
(oi) Lacum. (rr- xlviii. sss)-

(iv) interpolatione There sre very few oi these. Ism
convinced of the spurionsness oi only two passages, 1v. 3. 55, ῦ6
(from 1. 2) snd v. 9. 41, where s line hss been lost. In certain
cases injudicious editing hes-caused lines to appear in un·
suitsble positione.

Thus in 111. 32 (26). 61 sqq. we have two versione oi the
compiiment ιο Virgil, ss Mr Munro hss scutely pointed cut;
11. 1. 37, 38 is s genuine Propertisn distich, out oi ploce in its
present position. Perhaps it was written in the margin of the
poet’e us. This msy hove been the csse too with rr. e (7).
23, 24 end note.

1 have added s compariscn oi the readings in this edition
with those oi Baehrens end Pclmer.

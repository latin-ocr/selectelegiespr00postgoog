APPENDIX A.

We heve no arieting rra. oi Propertius that can be traeed back
earlier than the llth century: and it ie probable that all go
back to a single archetype.

The Codex Neapolitcmu (N.) hae ol lete generally been eon-
aidered to be the beat. But ita claime heve been latelyattecked
by Prol. Beehrena (in hie Prelace, p. vii), who har been replied
to by Hert Leo (Rh. Mna. al, p, 431), by Prol. Ellis (American
Journal ol Philology 1. p. 389), and Prot. A.1>a1mer(nerma-
thena, forthcoming number). It ia beyond my limita to enter
upon thie controverey; ao 1 content myeeli with obserwing that
it reema to me thet Baehrene' riews require very considerable
qualifications. It ie probably to be assigned to the llth oen·

tury.

Other nes. arethe Codex Vossianus (about 1360, imperfect),
the Florentium (end ol llth or beginning of l5th century),
'ottoboniano-Vaticanus (end oi llth century), Dauentriauue
(illo-1420). All elthece have been recently collated by

Baehrene; and irom them he reconstructs the archetype which
he ealle 0.

Besidea these may be mentioned the Perusinus (1467), which
once belonged to Scaliger, andos which there ia a collation in
the edition ol Mr Palmer, its rediscoverer, end the Groniuyanur
(G.) which was formerly held in high eeteem, buthan lately

tallen into dielevour, owing to ite numerous interpolatione.

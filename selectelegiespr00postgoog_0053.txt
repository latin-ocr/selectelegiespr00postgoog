Besides the above we find 'ether periphrases where
simple verbs might have been expected, e. g. 1. ll.
, 13 uacet alterius blandos audire srrsurros and 1. 14. 13
tum mihi cessuros spondent mea gaudia reges (= reges,
quae mea ,00111110 sunt, mihi cedent).

In estimating the velue of the foregoing evidence
we must first bear in mind 11101 these in·
finitive forms 010 very convenient for ssffll'gffism

be expected to occur with eosne frequency. The'hest
way of ascertaining what deduction is 10 be made fer
this is to examine the frequency with which such per-i-
phrases occurjn other elegiae poete. As before,I will
take Ovid for the test¹.

Ovid’s elegiae poenis contain about 6 tirnes as many
verses as Propertiusi. 0. about 24,0001ines. In these
24,0001inesl find the following verbs denoting desire,
dre, and preparation, dec, occur-ring with the inf. the
following number estimes: 11010 31, cupio 15, opto 5¹,
libet 6, 1101111010 1⁸, posco 1², [atinam ove1·8times],
parole, incipio 10, coepi 5, ordior 4001110111),
experior 4, perpe 2, molier 1⁹, laboro 5, tempto 15,
conoe· 3. This gives the following result: Propertius
64, Ovid 123. If the same proportien were observed,
Ovid would shew 384. ’Το this must be added the
fect that the Ovidian examples have not been weeded
like the Propertien, and that, if we eonnted up
the instances where the phrase is really otiose, the

¹ Ihove used Le Maire’s Index to obtain these results, and
Ihave selected the mest characteristic class that Ι could, that
containing poenam not being availsble through deliciencies in
, the index. lt is netsworthy thet several of the verbs eccur
more frequently in the Metamorphoses than in the Elegiae
poema, showing that too much weight must not be assigned te
the metrical convenience 01 the forms. Their prevalence there

isprobably dne to the poem being a history of inchoate and
intennpted lives. ·

I have ,hitherto been mainly occupied in tracing
the peculiarities where they have had an mm a a·
injurious influente upon his work; but we rra otiarer:
must not forget that tharsis another side. “m''
To them we owe the greater part of that sostendit
which, as we hare seen, Martial singles
out for his praise. Not only is the vo-

> cabulary on which he draws unusually large¹‚ but
he employa it with the greatest freedcm¹. 'l'hus he
frequently uses aword in a fresh sense on the strength
of some analogy. E. g. on the analogy of laetae
‘inconstancy’ he has manitas in the sense of ‘con-
stancy' ιιι. 13 (ll). 14, and pondua hobae ‘to be
constant‚' ιιι. 20 (17). 22. This and the frequency
with which words occur with slight changes in mean·
ing give an ¹unequalled freshness and variety to his
st le.

, yBut this freedom is by no means confined to his
expression. It is even more apparent in
his thought Ihavc spoken already of

>the extraordinary originality or rather
singularity of his conceptione. This is shown in many '
ways ; perhaps in none so clearly as the boldness of
his imagery. Ι do not know any ancient writer who

difficulty and obscurity is due to other causes which
may be more easily defined. .
First aad chiefly it is due to 0 00110111 0091100000
“ and indirectmss in his manner oi con-
oaiving and presenting 011 idea. Where d
other poets would bring it immediately

may be found ; and often his indicatione are by 110

INPRODUOTION. xxv

¹ It represents the spirit oi Cynthia as appearing in
a dream to the poet shortly ester her Ε (mm
death. In it she rebulres him for so soon ff}
forgetting their love (la-22) and ior his
carelessness in superintending her lunernl..(23-34).
She insinuates that her death has been caused by
poison end that the tortura test should bc applied to
her slaves (et-38). She eccuses Propertius of ex-

last two elegies oi Book iv. represent the final act of

neglect precise expressions like those in vv. t, 6 and
14 in te iam uires somnus habere potestl Why tho

INPRODUOTION. lxeii

authors have been brief to obscurity or full to re
dundanae: but few have been both. Still rarer is
it to lind such oversubtlety in the arrangement and

connexion of ideas. Rarest of all to find this '

altemating with an absolute disregard of their con-
nexion. But it raises our wonder, indeed, to find
all these qualities united in a single writer, and we
cannot believe that there can be anything esocem

But the phenomena which meet us next are stranger
still, and, I believe, even unique ¹. As they have nct

in a very peculiar way. After giving us
an idea in one form, he frequently gives
it immediately in another, and treats this new

It may be said. however, that Ι have misinterpreted their
significante. Some will think perhaps that they are merely
unusual manifestatione ot verbosity ; others, perhaps, that they
are only strange examples ol the Latin tendency which is most
markedin the poeta to repeat an idea for emphasis or olear-
ness, and that here too Propertius is ultra-Latin. See p. xciii.
That both these explanations are possible, and perhaps partially
true, I would admit, and the more cheeriuhy ac as 1 hold most
flrmly the conviction that there are no linguistio iaots which
are really simple, and that their explanation, like themselves,
must often ramiiy into the most widely separated regiom both

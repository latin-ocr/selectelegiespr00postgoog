onas esse put'o ‘to baar with the beauteous is no turca?
'soin rr. 1. 6, rr. 6(7). 33,1v. 8 (9). 23, 24, rr. 23. 7
and notes, v. 5. 54 uersibus auditis quid nisi uerbo ferest
(a play 011 aerbo dore to cheat) ¹. In some of these
cases the literal and metaphorical ore blended. So also
in lv. 3 (4). 4 Tigris et Euphrates aab tuo iarcflcccrct
where the idea of the actual motion of the rivers
is united with the metaphorioal ides ol their passing
under Augustus' jurisdiction. We have, however,
nothing ss bad as Ovid's experiments in this line, oi
which I will quote two, iu order to show how hope-
lessly false and hollow tho thing may become when
not guided by genuine poetioal ieehng. Trist 3. 5.
45, 46 ,

non mihi quaerenti pessumdare cuncte petitum

Caesareum caput est quod capot orbis erat (two bodies
and one head)

Pont 2. 5. 38

sed sunt tus pectora lactc
, 'et non calcata candidiora niue (s good metaphor spoilt,
material ond metaphorical ‘iairness’ being confused).

Ι am sure that my readers will pardon this some·
what long, though imperfect, discussion ii
Ι have shown them that in Propertius we &mm
are dealing with no ordinary phenomena
These contrasts, these extravaganoies, these fluctuatione
and incoherencies‚ these half-formed or misshapen
thoughts, what do they signifyl What is the secret of
this chsosl Itis that here we are loolring on a stage
4 in the realizetion of thought which is not usually pre
sented to our view. In other writers we only see the

full-formed crystals, sometimes flawed and dim, some-

> times bright and clear. In Propertius thoughtis
ν crystallizing still. It is still comparatively emorphous

¹ These must bc distinguished hom cases where the con·
fusion is in the idea itseli; where, ior example, a (iod ond his

statue (v. 1. 7) or a river and river-(iod are not discriminated
(rr. 3. 45 n.. r. 2. ln). ν

INTRODUOTION. ⁴ cx'xxiii

Propertius never avoids, or perhaps rather affecte
the assimilation os the first half of the symmacus

pentameter to the second, asin ffi'lmss‘lffl

reccidit inque suos mensa supina pedes s. 6. 41.
or semper amica mihi semper et uxor eris 11. 6. 42.
or

The same tendency is seen at work in some
endings that remind ae of Greek,

hunc superet Zetes hunc super et Calais r. 20. 26.

uret et Eoos uret el Hesperios rr. 6. 44.

candida Nesaee caerula Cymothoe 111. 21 (18). 16.
As already said (p. lxxxix.) he does not avoid the
concurrence ol similar terminatione especially when
the termination is d (sa also Catullus) ¹. Nor does

he obseres the artificial rule of not ending a couplet
witha nom. part, e. g. epona ends a verse in'1v. 20. 30

and sedeas ιν. 15 (16). 24. He ie not eo ceresolas ””“·
Ovid not to allow the sense toran on from the
hexameter to the pentameter, or from one couplet

ieiuni serpentia honos’. .

In his employment oi alicime he stands between c

He hae 23 cases oi elision oi a long syllable before

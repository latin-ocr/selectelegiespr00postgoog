lastedfive years, which is probably exclusive ol a year
ol separation ¹. <

For two years hardly a cloud marrad the serenity
of the lovers' day. There were no doubt
the usual quarrels, pertinge, and recon- mmd-
oiliationa 3 and at one time it seemed possible that
cynthia would be tcmpted by the splendid offers ol a
Praetor to accompany him abroad. But Cynthia was
true to her seli-chosen lover, and tha Praetor had to

depart alone. Propertius on his part was equally?

firm in resisting tha solicitations and expostulations
by which his father’s friends¹ sought to draw him
away lrom his mistress. The majority of the elegias

in tbe first book are the outcome of this, the most ε

fortunate period ol his attachment ; and in their tone
they differ widely from the rest. There is a notiecable
'absence of the bitterness which pervadas some ol the
later (lynthia elegias3 they are gentler‚ tenderet,
” and more trustful. Another source of anxiety also

passed away. After his power was established and '

hir victory over his rivals magnificently celebrated,
Augustus turned his attention to social reforma. The

evil wlriclr called most clamorously sor redress was · ·

the wide prevalence of celibacy and the moral cor·
ruption which it at once betolrened and aggravated.
Augustus brought forward a repressive measure, of tha
same tendency as tha one passed in aa. 18, inflicting
severe penalties on those who continued obstinately
in the single estate⁸. This would probably have parted
tho lovers, as Propertius in spite ol‘ his· protestatione

⁸ The measure is generally placed in so. 27. It is probably
referred to in r. 8. 21 (n), and it is the subject ol 11. 7, which

was written some time alter the law had been proposed (v. 2 Α

speelr. 1001100 the following: (i)e frequent use 01
‘potentiale' not however nearly so frequent es in
Prop. (101 64. 199 uos nolite pati nostrum uanescere
luctum, id. 101 cupieris contre contendere monstrum
0010010, vele, copor¹. (ii) some full expressions which
recall the ‘disjunctiveness' 01 Propertius without how·
ever going anything like 00 far, eg. Oet. 68. 99, 100
Troia infelice sepultum detinet extremo terro 011000Μ
eolo. The expression, though full, is periectly con·
sistent3 sor terra is ‘the country' and 0010 ‘the soil!
Contrast the exemplos given above So errem animi
(let. 65. 4011110). (iii) In his use 01 the plupen‘. Oe·
tullus reminds us oi Propertius without however
leaving the 0000000 idiom so fer behind3 16. 28, 64.
158, 313. (iv) A certain oddity sbout the 00001 in
61. 318 prono in pollice torquens, 22. 17 tem gaudet
1000. ln conclusion I may notice 64. 317 100οΙ1000
extremo tempore which is very lilre the Propertiun
abl. insultet morte mee (l. 0 00 p. 0.) end 1010000 l'or
‘thirsty' Oet. 68. 79, Prop. IV. 14 (15). 18.

Propertius was more affected by the living influente
01 his contemporaries. Amongst these we
must mention Virpe‘l first As we heve
seen, Propertius wes one oi' his friends, end he shared
the high estimste os his genius which wes general in
Rome. The well-known passage 01 the end 01 the
second (third) book is very instructius, es it ehews us
001 only Propertius’ opinion 01 virgil, but 0100 110
curicus wey in which what he had reed or heard would
, work in his mind end tslre new end indefinite forms.
- The passage is not so much 00 account as nn echo 01

viros.

¹ It 10 uncertain whether some 01 the expressions 01 desire
‹lo not erise out 01 Getullus' ardent impulsive temperement.
Here, es in the cese 01 Propertius (000 ebore, p. nlo), it 10 0
question 01 degree. There is 00 doubt thet this lulneee 01
‚expression is partly e characteristic 01 early hetin, end thus
will connectio both 00000 with mehele tendenciee.

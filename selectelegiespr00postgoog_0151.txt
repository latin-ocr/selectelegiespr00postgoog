sufferre, pedes, properate laborem. Compare Attius
Fr. 72 ita 'territo membra animo aegroto coaetant
‘sufferre haberem. I do not find any coincidences
between thoughts or phrases of Propertius and the
fragments of the other old scenio poeta.
Peneia and perhaps Peraeae I believe he ,
- had read ; and perhaps it is to their study that we are
to attribute certain prosoic ond even conversationel
expressions which later, poeta esehcwed, as below the
, dignity of poetry. In this respect Propertius re-
sembles Catullus who never avoids a proso word or ex·

Catull. Proleg. p. xxii. Such words areseaire ‘oozam'

poems will make Cynthia· more renowned than the
mistresses of Calvus and Catullus, Iu his thoughts

much to Catullus. He owes something however.
E. g. Catull. 45. 9 Amor dextram sternuit approba-

are chiefly in the framework of the language‚ so to

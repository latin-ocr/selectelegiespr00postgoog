separate category. In Tibullus there ere 28 in 920
pentametors, ie. 20 ‘liquid' 5 ‘nou-liquid’ and
3 in ihus. [Dr Athinson includes the spurious poenus
in this oalouletion The figures should be 23:17
÷3÷3 respectively in about 620 pentameters.] In
Catullus the rule is not observed at all; nor is -a'bua
used as an ending in any ease. In his 320 pente·
meters trisyllabis endings ooour 50 times (surely ⁴
there must be some mistake here ; I make thern 79), 20
out of which are non-liquide. Thus there is e gradual
establishment of the rule which we observe to be
almost invariable in Propertius

This reads very plausible 3 but I am afraid aster
all itis only a maresnest Mr Fennell has
suggested to me that the reason why most gssnifflf‘m‘
trisyllabio audinga contain a ‘liquid' is
that most trisplhrhles contain a liquid! He has
taken the trouble to go through the greater part oi
the first book of Propertius Amongst 271 trisyl·
lables he found 204 ‘liquid' and 67 ‘non-liquid!
In 318 lines of Ovid’s Tristia he found 140 trisyl-
lables, 100 ‘liquid' audio ‘non-liquid! Thus we
should expect ‘liquid' endings to predominate largely.
But it may be urged that there is still a margines
differenoe. This may be accidental, though I do not
think it is, as will he seen below.

If this and other arguments hold, Dr Atkinson’s
' theory totters to its base. Stetistioally, indeed, it
is much less probahle than the view which I have
attributed to Mr Paley‚ and whioh he rejects for it.
The theory that a trisyllabio ending is only permis-
sible when the first half of the verse m , ΝΜ,
ends with a corresponding word of the eatmapcyds ae·
same or similar termination—for this is ¹ ‘m'
the way I should state the theory—moreover ex-
plains the metrioal growth in the three poeta just
as well.

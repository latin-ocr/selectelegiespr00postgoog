Propertium preponderanoc would be still more evident.
I do not claim undue importence sor these figures,
which are from the nature of the case imperfect, and,
Ι doubt not, in sorno particulare contestable. Iouly
appeal to them to confirm the impressione which every
unprejudiced reader must gether from reading the
poenis himself.

We have thus seen that they occur sar less sre-
quently in Ovid than in Propertius ; and unprejudiced
and expericnced readers will probably admit without
further demonstration, that they cannot be regarded
as wholly or chietly the effect of metrica] necessity ¹.
Another explanation claims to be considered. May
not Propertius here been snared, as it were, by certain
forms of rhythm and expressionl Or, to put it in
another way, may not particular phrases and turns
of metro have reproduced themselves mechanically in
bis poemsl That this is possible, will be allowed by
all who have watched with attention either their oum
habits of speech and writing or those of others. Tho
persistence oi' these sorms isone of the most interest·
ing phenomena of language. Any one who has ob
scrved how sorno sashionable trick oi verbiage or cant·
phrase of the bour is taken up and introduced on every
possible occasion, not only in the streets but even in
educated society, will reudily recognize the irregular
actions of a principle which is the parcnt of stylo in
the individuul and idiom in a nation. Tlrat such per-
sistence of phrases is very marked in Propertius, I
should be tho last to deny 3 and that it is to be explain-
ed as due to weakness oi will, Ι should not venture to
essert It moy at least be probably supposed to be Α

¹ Another view is possible, that they are the remeius of a
certain redundanoe oi expression which we find in early Latin3
in which case they will be related to the other archaisme of
Propertius. Ido not deny that some of them are. But this
will only account lora portion. Compare p. cxliii.

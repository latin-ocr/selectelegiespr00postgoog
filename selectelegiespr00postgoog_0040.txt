INPBODUOPION. xxxi

his literary friends were Vispil, 101 whose genius he ⁴
expresses the warmest admiration in the wellknown
passage 111. 32 (26). 61 sqq, his senior, and ovas, his
junior. The latter tells us he was united to Proper·
tius by 1110 right 01 friendship, and that 110 frequently
heard him 100110 his love poems, opportunities which
he certainly turned 10 good account Other members
01 Propertius' circle 01 friends were Ponticas, an epic
poet (1. 1 3 9), also mentioned by Ovid (Tr. 4. 10. 47),
Bassus (1. 4), possibly the sameas the iambic poet
mentioned by Ovid (1. 0.), and Lynceus, possibly a
pseudonym, a tragic writer (111. 32). Besides these
we hear 01 Gallus, not improbably a relation 01 the
poet’s on the mother’s side (1. 5 ; 10 ; 13; 20) [distinct
1101111110 (1111111011. 21, 101 whom see above], Tullus,
uenerally supposed 10 be a nephew 01 L. Volcatius
Tullus, who was consul in 110, 33 (1. 6 3 14,1v. 22),
Pactus (1v. 6 (7)), Panthus (111. 14 (13)), Postumus,
the husband os 1111011000οα (1v. 11 (12)), and Demo

phoca (111. 15 (14)). That this isa complete list 01
tho friends 01 Propertius is not 101· an instant 10 bo
supposed. Ι1 only embraees those whose names have
been associated with 1110 surviving portion 01 his
poema. We may well conjecture that Ovid is not 1110
only instance 01 a distinguished contemporary enjoying
his iriendship without obtaining a place in his writinga

the only poem addressed to him shews3 111. 1, especially 11. 21-
24. His flattery 01 the emperor 11 no doubt gross to our teste:
but not a whit more so than that 01 his contemporaries. We
cannot in 11111011 censure him for calling 1 man deas 10 whom
1110 Senate 111011 had deoreed divine honours (Dion 51. 20) and
01 whom Horace could write Od. 3. 5 (11010 tonantem credi· .
dimus Iouem regnare: praesens diuus habebitur Augustus
adiectis Britannis impono grauibusque Persis, and 3. 3. ll
(Pollux 01 uagus Hercules) quos iuter Augustus recumbens

us suspect that thera is 101110 truth in the story ot the ceno

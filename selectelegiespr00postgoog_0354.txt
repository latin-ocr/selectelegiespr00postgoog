boras, v. n ’111

plur. passive, eg. uertims'nt and in damnus, do. Thus it
means ‘turning’ ‘ohanging’ and, as a substantive, a ‘tumblor'
on horsabaoh aeomersault-turner (r. 66). The god seems
chiefly to ba a symbol oi the revoiving sesaons and their
ohanging produots‚ and thus appears us a Latin Proteus whose
various shapes are desoribed in our poem. Hanoe Horaoe oalls
a man who was the opposite ol versatile (εὐτράπελος Ver·
tumuit quotquot aaut notae iniquis 1511. 2. 7. 14). asides

the myth in 0v. M. 14. 623 squ). His worship vas a genuine
Italian oult; and 11 the statement that it was brought from
Etruria is not a misoonoeption based on the name Vicae

Elegy xvii. (xviii.) was written after the
death oi Marcellus in 23. ῐ1110 allusione to 8110011-
pedition against the Parthians to recoverthe standards
of Crassus iii. (11), iv. (v.) 48, xi. (xii.) 3, 4probsbly
point 80 the suine period. For, it is to be observed
that nowhere does Propertius 111118 that 8110 standards
have been recovered. His exultation is always pro·
spective. The last poem iu tho book, as already said,
must have been written six years after the beginning
of the Cynthia attachment. On the other hand, cl.

proposed to use in citing Propertius, gave the new division.
Since then ull is changed. The two last 0118010, Baehrens
and Palmer, have returned to tho old order, and I cen only
regret that my own book had advanced too lar to permit my
making 8110 change. [Baehrena I may 01111, though printing

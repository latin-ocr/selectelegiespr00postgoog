Nouus.

One of the most common end characteristic idioms
> is his predicative use of nouus. For ex-

ample, he does not say ‘the ‘chorte Tar· Μ*
peia' but‘the chostity ol Tarpeia' (1. 16. 2). This is
a sort of converse to the predicative uae of

the participle (or adjective)¹: thus mortuus Wffllfffl‘m
Caesar omnia perturbauit ‘the death of pre Μ
Caesar threw all into confusion': hut Caesarie mora
in foro iacebat (cf. 111. ὅ. 6 n) ‘Caesen when dead
(the dead body of 0.), layin the forum.’ It is, without
doubt, a native Latin idion, though it is also found in
Greek. It appears eg. in (licere, fontium perennitates
‘the everlasting fountain flows,'-the ‘fountains ever-
lastingly flowing': cf. Potts’ Lat Prose, p. 39. But
Propertius pushes it iar beyond its ordinary

range. It is only used, as a rule, where the Olgffffffl [θ’
leading idea is that contained in the princi· φ’
pal noun, and where the form ol the rest of the sentence
is accommodated to thet idea. It is not used as a mere
periphrasis or conversion oi the ordinary expression,
irreapecte'ue of the coenet, which is the Propertian use.
Cicero says he does not fear the eleepiness of Lan-
tulus (Lentuli somnum), Catullus has talis isto meus
stupor nil uidet. In both these cases the adoption of
the form is appropriate, as itis the quality in the
man that is emphasized. But Propertius would have
ventured on iste stupor periit ‘your besotted lover is
dead,' though the idea in the noun has nothing to do

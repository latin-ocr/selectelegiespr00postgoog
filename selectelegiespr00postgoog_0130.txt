INTRODUCTION. cxxi

A curious use of ut has been mentioned above,
p. xc. nc, which appears in one place as

ni (w. supra),'is put for at aon ‘so that...
not' in lv. 10 (ll). 24 and not improbably v. 11. 4⁷.

asamar.

nam appears where no negative aud evena positive
answer is required, v. 3. 23,11. 3. 23.

Hitherto I have spoken oi particular words and
forms of words, so iar as the word or form
may be said to have a particular use ⁸
meaning attached to it. I shall now say
a little on their combination end interection in sen·
tenses The distinction is a convenient one though
, not always easy to apply.

Stress os the sentence.

Ihave already pointed out (p. lxii.) that thisis often

where we should least expect it, and more

examplcs maybe got from the notes The §0²32st θ’
non-perception oi this has sometimes led

commentatore wrong. Thus 111. 32 (26). 72 huic licet
ingratos Tityrus ipse cenat means ‘a Tityrus might
sing to her and she would be ungrateful¹.’ Proper·
tius olten leaves the predicate to be taken care ol by
the emphasis alone, where others would have helped it
by inserting a word like csse. See note on 1. 8. 62.
Sometimes a part or adj. contains a thought which
would have been more clearly conveyed by a separate
sentence; 1. 19. 24 frangitur assiduis certo puella
minis (ia quemuis c), 111. 31 (25). 9 cum te iussit
habere puellam cornua Iuno ‘ma1d as thou wast‚’ v. 9.
22 terraque non ullas feto ministrat aquas ‘in spite

of its teeming breast,’ ‘from its teeming bresst’

In this poem Propertius apologises lor being late in kecping
an appointment with Cynthia. His excuse is tho opening ot
the temple oi Apollo Palatinus er Aetius, built by damnatus to
commemorate the battle of Actium, and dedicated in ne. 28.
Compare the introduction to r. 6.

Propertius gives a description of it, one more minute than
ne find elsewhere. He begins with the outside and the eloisters
which surrounded it, as the porticus Octauiae snrrounded the
Ι ternples ot Jupiter, June, dcc. In one ot these porticam (rnn-
rnvn cru eonrrcrnvs Monam. Aueyr.) was the famous Palatina
Library with its collectione ol ancient a'nd contemporary works,
and also a colossel bronze statue ot Apollo by a Tuscae artist,
which is said to hare represented tha Emperor himself. The
Senate was sometimes eonvened here, Tae. dnn. 2. 37. The
pillars in the open cloisters were ol piatio arnico marhle, and
adorned with statues ol the Danaids and their cousins. The
templs itsell was oi marble irom Luna (now Carrara), with
ivery sculptured deors, and it contained within statues oi
Latona and Diana and the lamous Apollo citharoedus, a
marble statue by Scopas3 also a group oi lonr oren hythe
hand ol Myron. There were besides other valuable works ol
art there. See Mr Bum's Reme and the Carnpngna, p. 175,
and the passages quoted by him.

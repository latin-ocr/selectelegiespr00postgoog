Ruit it 11111 be said, that all this only proves thet
there are some jeuels os thought and diction scattered
through the worhs oi Propertius 3 and it will be essert
ed, as it has been asserted before, that this is all the
excellence os which hs is capable. This is prima
sacis plausible. For, as Ι have said above, Propertius
is essentiully unequa13 and even in the best oi his
poems there occurs much that we should gladly see
altered or removed. And hence it has happened, not
only in ancient, but also in modern times, that some
have assigned him a poetical position below that of
Tibullus and oi Ovid ; just as some minds, and pro·
bably more than is suspected, find the rugged mountain
torrent less attractivs than the rippling village brook
and even than the dead level of a eaucl. And yet the
judgment is really unfair. Propertius often maintains
a high general excellence for long passages and whole
poems ata time. In the tendet style I may men·

oution and her escape and revenge con hardly be im-
proved, 11 xiv. (xm). In a higher styleis lv. x. (xi)
which expresses the national indignation against Oleu-
patra. The description of the battle of Actium (v. vi)
may well compare with that of Virgil. Fancy and
humour have rarely been so well combined as in v. ix. ;
the description in vv. 27 sqq. always reminds me oi
the Faerie Queene.

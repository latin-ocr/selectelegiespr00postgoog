The first thing which strikes us is his very bold use

δ oi hypallage. Hypallage, or the construc-

tion oi an epithet with a noun to which it

does not properly apply, is a relic oi an early stage οἱ

“ languagc. Not to speak of cases where

itis due to irrational attraction by adja-
cent words, which of course become rarer as languaga
is improved and thought ohtains a greater mastery
over its materiale, hypallage is due to a certain inde·
finiteness in the conception. An attribute which
‘ should properly only qualify a single noun is allowed
= a wider influence, sc that it still qualitas that noun,
hut qualities it indirectly while directly qualifying the
word on which that noun depende. We thus get it
exerting its influence over a bracket, as it were. Thus
we have ‘the wandering [shelter of a river]' uago
[fluminis lrospitio]1. 20. 10 instead of ‘the slrclter of
a wandering rirer,’ uagi fluminis hospitio. This
liberty oi placing two words in agreement which are
not directly connected, is restricted by a rule which is
already indicated in what I have said. So far as I
know, it has not yet been pointed out, though its
rationale is pretty clear. Tae roaga afara epitltct mag

cannot be expected to spread a meaning which the
writer has limited to a special point over the rest of
its context Thus we find in almost all casea, certainly
in all that I know in Propertius, either (a) an adj.
